"Magic"



It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so

I've never been awake
I've never seen a day break
Leaning on my pillow in the morning
Lazy day in bed
Music in my head
Crazy music playing in the morning light

It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so

I love a sunny day
Dream of far away
Dreaming on my pillow in the morning
I've never been awake
I've never seen a day break
Leaning on my pillow in the morning light

It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so

It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so
Never believe

"Unfamiliar"



[Selena Gomez:]
Feeling so good, so great
Until I really look into your eyes
Tell me how bad it is, what you did
'Cause you know that I'm not about that life

Your secrets have secrets, that's no lie
Why we gotta be so under the weather
We can only have ourselves, can't rely on nobody else
To put your pieces back together

Over and over again
Repeat what you already did
What did you find?
Nothing has fixed what they said
Except that we don't understand
Why do they lie?

It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide (yeah, yeah)
Easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide

Never would give you away
You'll be unfamiliar with pain
You'll never cry

[Justin Bieber:]
I've been feeling down for a while
Wishing you could see beyond my eyes
You know very well what I did
Swear that I'm not about that life

I told you my secrets that made you cry
Said you want the truth thought it'd make you feel better
We can only grow from here
Do reconstruction
And put the pieces back together (yeah)

[Selena Gomez:]
Over and over again
Repeat what you already did
What did you find? (I was wrong, I was wrong)
Nothing has fixed what they said
Except that we don't understand
Why do they lie?

It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide (yeah, yeah)
It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide

[Maejor Ali:]
Yeah, If I told you that I miss you
Would you understand it?
Or would you take it for granted?
I miss the little things, talks about the stars and the planets
And you speaking to me in Spanish, "Te extra√±o"
Can't even lie
Lately things have been different
You was my sweet tooth
Now it seems I need a filling
And now that the pain is numb, I'm looking for a feeling
The fast life isn't as appealing
You still listening?
If you are, I wonder how you have been nowadays
I know we haven't talked much since we parted ways
I know I missed your birthday, a couple of holidays
I never knew it'd be this hard with you far away
Secrets, all this over some secrets
I look back and tell myself to keep it
I wish that I had looked you in the eye and just told you a lie
'Cause I cared too much to see you cry

[Selena Gomez:]
It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide (yeah, yeah)
It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide

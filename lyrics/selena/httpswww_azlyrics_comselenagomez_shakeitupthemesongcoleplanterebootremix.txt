"Shake It Up Theme Song (Cole Plante Reboot Remix)"



Don't like waiting, don't like waiting
Let's go right now
Gotta' hit the ground
Dancing 'fore the music slows down
What I'm sayin', what I'm sayin'
If there's something to fix
Take it to another level
This is the remix

Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up! Shake it up!

All together now
Shake it up! Shake it up!

Break it down, break it down
I've got something to say
When you're dancing with me
It's like we go M-I-A
Make a scene, make a scene
Nobody can ignore
Don't knock it, till you rock it
We can't take it no more

Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up! Shake it up!
All together now
Shake it up! Shake it up!

Sh-sh-sh-Shake it up
You gotta change it up
And if the days not right
Just brush it off tonight
Put on your attitude
You're in my pocket, move
And when you've had enough
Sh-sh-sh-shake it up!

All together now
Shake it up! Shake it up!
Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up
DJ, set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up
Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up
DJ, set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up

Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up
DJ, set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up

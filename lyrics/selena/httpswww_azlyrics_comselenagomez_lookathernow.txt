"Look At Her Now"



They fell in love one summer
A little too wild for each other
Shiny till it wasn't
Feels good till it doesn't

It was her first real lover
His too till he had another
Oh god when she found out
Trust levels went way down

Of course she was sad
But now she's glad she dodged a bullet

Took a few years
To soak up the tears
But look at her now
Watch her go

Mmm mmm mmm
Look at her now
Watch her go
Mmm mmm mmm
Wow
Look at her now
Mmm mmm mmm
Look at her now
Watch her go
Mmm mmm mmm
Wow
Look at her now

Fast nights that got him
That new life was his problem
Not saying she was perfect
Still regrets that moment

Like that night
Wasn't wrong, wasn't right
What a thing to be human
Made her more of woman

Of course she was sad
But now she's glad she dodged a bullet

Took a few years
To soak up the tears
But look at her now
Watch her go

Mmm mmm mmm
Look at her now
Watch her go
Mmm mmm mmm
Wow
Look at her now
Mmm mmm mmm
Look at her now
Watch her go
Mmm mmm mmm
Wow
Look at her now

Wow
Look at her now

Wow
Look at her now

She knows she'll find love
Only if she wants it
She knows she'll find love
Uhh
She knows she'll find love
Only if she wants it
She knows she'll find love
On the up from the way down
Look at her now

Watch her go
Mmm mmm
Look at her now
Ohhhhh
She knows she'll find love
Only if she wants it
She knows she'll find love
Look at her now yeah
She knows she'll find love
(She knows she will)
Only if she wants it
She knows she'll find love
Wow

Look at her now

"Let Me Get Me"



'Like a Prayer' surrounding us, moving effortlessly
Every word is relief
I'm on dance-floor therapy, all my babies and me
But tonight it's for free

No self-sabotage, no letting my thoughts run
Me and the spiral are done
Burn this camouflage I've been wearing for months
Tryna let a little happy in for once

I need to let my mind rest
While my body reflects

Ah ooh, don't get me down, I won't let me get me
Ah ooh, don't get me down, I won't let me get me
Ah ooh, I'm good right now, I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside
Out

Diving in ferociously, dancing intimately
I'm so connected to me
In the dark I'm letting go so anonymously
I guess this is what it feels like to be free

I need to let my mind rest
While my body reflects

Ah ooh, don't get me down, I won't let me get me
Ah ooh, don't get me down, I won't let me get me
Ah ooh, I'm good right now, I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside

Out, don't get me down, I won't let me get me
Ah ooh, don't get me down, I won't let me get me
Ah ooh, I'm good right now, I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside

Oh my! I guess this is what it feels like to be free
Oh my! I guess this is what it feels like to see me

(Down)
(Get down)
Don't get me
(Down)
Oh oh
(Get down)
Don't get me
Ah ooh
(Get down)
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside

Out, don't get me down, I won't let me get me
Ah ooh, don't get me down, I won't let me get me
Ah ooh, I'm good right now, I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside out
Out

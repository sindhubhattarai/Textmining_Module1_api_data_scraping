"Boyfriend"



I want a boyfriend
But I just keep hitting dead ends
Try to take a shortcut, but I get cut
Again and again
I want a boyfriend
Tell me, are there any good ones left?
I keep finding wrong ones, but I want love
Again and again
I want a boyfriend

I been up all night
Pretty restlessly
Think I might know why
(Uh)
I've been doing just fine
But baby, I don't mean
That I'm feeling anti you and me

There's a difference between a want and a need
Some nights I just want more than me
I know that there's a fine line between
It's not what I need, but
(Yeah)

I want a boyfriend
But I just keep hitting dead ends
Try to take a shortcut, but I get cut
Again and again
(Yeah)
I want a boyfriend (Uh-huh)
Tell me, are there any good ones left?
I keep finding wrong ones, but I want love
Again and again

I want a boyfriend
I want a boyfriend

I could phone a friend, use a hotline or something
But that won't get the job done
(Uh-huh)
'Cause every time I try
Every time they lie (Uh-huh)
I get a little anti you and me

There's a difference between a want and a need
Some nights I just want more than me
I know that there's a fine line between
It's not what I need, but
(Ooh–ooh)

I want a boyfriend
But I just keep hitting dead ends
Try to take a shortcut, but I get cut
Again and again

I want a boyfriend (Uh–huh)
Tell me, are there any good ones left?
I keep finding wrong ones, but I want love
Again and again

I want a boyfriend

(Yeah)
I want a boyfriend
(Yeah)
(I want a)

"A Sweeter Place"



Is there a place where I can hide away?
Red lips, french-kiss my worries all away
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugar-coat the taste
Sweeter place
There must be a sweeter

(Place where I can)

(Ooh) You really wanna know where I've been all this time
So let me tell ya
(Ooh) Got two feet on the ground and felt what real is like
What it was like living out of the scene, out in the wild
Learning to breathe up in the clouds, far from the crowds
I can't believe I can be loud
Holding hands with the darkness
And knowing my heart is allowed
Allowed

Is there a place where I can hide away?
Red lips, french-kiss my worries all away
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugar-coat the taste
A sweeter place
There must be a sweeter

(Place where I can)

(Place where I can)

As I fantasize
So much to see, I'm in paradise
Oh I, always seems I'm new inside
Deep, deep down in me, I go now baby, born to fly
Oh I, now, see, how could it be
We will find our way, we'll find the things we seek
Ooh we, you see I'm mesmerized
Place that's just for me and I am cutting ties
Goodbye (Hmmm)

Is there a place where I can hide away? (Hide away)
Red lips, french-kiss my worries all away (All away)
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugar-coat the taste
Sweeter place
There must be a sweeter

(Place where I can)

(Place where I can)

Having no fear (No fear)
Heaven is near (Close by)
Oh whoa, head is so clear (So clear)
My sweeter place, my sweeter place
Having no fear (No fear)
Heaven is near (Close by)
Oh whoa, head is so clear (So clear)
My sweeter place, my sweeter place

Is there a place where I can hide away? (Hide away)
Red lips, french-kiss my worries all away (All away)
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugar-coat the taste
Sweeter place
There must be a sweeter

(Place where I can)

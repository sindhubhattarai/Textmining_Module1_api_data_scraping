"Selfish Love"



Nadie tiene que decírmelo
Hablas con otra que no soy yo
Y te confieso que viéndolo
Baby, me dan ganas de tenerte

Just a little crush, got me over here thinking
Does somebody else care, somebody else care?
I know we got trust, but you be gettin' me thinking
Does somebody else care, somebody else care?

Tú quieres darme celos
All this time and we still got that selfish love
You like makin' me jealous (I like makin' you jealous)
Es un juego que queda entre tú y yo
Tú y yo, tú y yo

(Yeah, yeah)
You know we got trust
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah)

Cómo me miran es obvio
Ven marca tu territorio
Este secreto entre los dos
Sé que te dan ganas de tenerme (Te dan ganas de tenerme)

I get just a little rush when you're over there thinking
Does somebody else care, somebody else care? (Ooh, ooh)
You know we got trust, but I like gettin' you thinking
Does somebody else care, somebody else care?

I like makin' you jealous (I like makin' you jealous)
Es un juego que queda entre tú y yo

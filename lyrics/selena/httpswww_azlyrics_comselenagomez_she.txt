"She"



Toh-ta-da-da-da-ta-da-ta-da
Ta-da-da-da-ta-da-ta-da
Ta-da-da-da-ta-da

She was too young to be the Hollywood type
Too pure to understand the lows and the highs
She didn't know if she was gonna survive
It all got so much better with time

All of the evil eyes
Tequila before sunrise
I'd tell her to watch her back
That she's worth more than that

'Cause she was a girl with good intentions
Yeah, she made some bad decisions
And she learned a couple lessons
Wish I could tell her
She was a girl with good intentions
Didn't need the second guessing
Didn't need to ever question
Wish I could tell her

She didn't know all of the hurt she could take
Her world was crumbling and so was her faith
Wish I could talk to her, 'cause what I would say
"Oh baby, you're enough to get you out of this place"

All of the flashing lights
Tequila before sunrise
I'd tell her to watch her back
That she's worth more than that

But she was a girl with good intentions
Yeah, she made some bad decisions
And she learned a couple lessons
Wish I could tell her
She was a girl with good intentions
Didn't need the second guessing
Didn't need to ever question
Wish I could tell her

Toh-ta-da-da-da-ta-da-ta-da
Ta-da-da-da-ta-da-ta-da
Ta-da-da-da-ta-da
I tried to tell her

I know you'll get the chance, to find who you are
I know you'll have the choice, before it gets too dark
I know you'll get the chance to find who you are
I know you'll have the choice

She was a girl with good intentions
Yeah, she made some bad decisions
And she learned a couple lessons
Wish I could tell her
She was a girl with good intentions (Wish I could show you)
Didn't need the second guessing (Wish I could show you)
Didn't need to ever question
Wish I could tell her

Toh-ta-da-da-da-ta-da-ta-da (Wish I could show you)
Ta-da-da-da-ta-da-ta-da
Ta-da-da-da-ta-da-ta-da (Wish I could show you)
Toh-ta-da-da-da-ta-da-ta-da (Wish I could show you)
Ta-da-da-da-ta-da-ta-da
Ta-da-da-da-ta-da-ta-da
Wish I could show you

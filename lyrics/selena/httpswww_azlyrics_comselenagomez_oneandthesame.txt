"One And The Same"



[Selena:]
You come from here,
I come from there.

[Demi:]
You rock out in your room,
I rock a world premiere.

We're more alike than
Anybody could ever tell
(ever tell)

[Demi:]
Friday, we're cool,
Monday, we're freaks.

[Selena:]
Sometimes we rule,
Sometimes we can't even speak.

[Demi:]
But we kick it off,
Let loose, and LOL
(LOL)

[Selena:]
It may seem cliché
For me to wanna say
That you're not alone
(that you're not alone)

[Demi:]
And you can call me uncool
But it's a simple fact
I got your back

[Both:]
'Cause we're one and the same
We're anything but ordinary
One and the same
I think we're almost legendary.

You and me
The perfect team
Chasing down the dream
We're one and the same!

[Demi:]
I'm kinda like you,
You're kinda like me.

[Selena:]
We write the same song
In a different key

[Both:]
It's got a rhythm, you and me
Can get along
(get along)

[Selena:]
And it may seem cliché
For me to wanna say
That you're not alone
(here I go again)

[Demi:]
And you can call me uncool
But it's a simple fact
I still got your back
(I still got your back)

[Both:]
'Cause we're one and the same
We're anything but ordinary
One and the same
I think we're almost legendary

You and me
The perfect team
Shaking up the scene,
We're one and the same!

[Selena:]
'Cause we're one and the same

[Demi:]
We're anything but ordinary

[Selena:]
One and the same

[Demi:]
We're something more than momentary!

[Selena:]
'Cause we're one
'Cause we're one

[Demi:]
We're anything but ordinary

You and me
The perfect team
Chasing down the dream
You and me
The perfect team
Shaking up the scene,
We're one and the same!

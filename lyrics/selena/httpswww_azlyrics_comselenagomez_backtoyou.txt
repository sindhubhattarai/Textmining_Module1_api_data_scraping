"Back To You"



Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with the cold evening
Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you (feeling about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it, even though I do (even though I do)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you

I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

We never got it right
Playing and re-playing old conversations
Over-thinking every word and I hate it
'Cause it's not me ('Cause it's not me)
And what's the point in hiding
Everybody knows we got unfinished business
And I regret it if I didn't say this isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you

I know I'd go back to you
I go back to you
I go back to you
I know I said I wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you

You know, my thoughts are running loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you

I'll go back to you
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(I go back to you, I go back to you)
I know I'd go back to you

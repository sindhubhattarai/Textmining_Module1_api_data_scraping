"Dance Again"



Happiness
Ain't something you sit back and you wait for
Mm-mm ah-ah
Confidence
Is throwing your heart through every brick wall
Mm-mm ah-ah

I kick-start the rhythm
All the trauma's in remission
No, I don't need permission

Feels so, feels so, feels so good to dance again
Feels so, feels so, feels so good to dance again
With my emotions undressed, I'm going in
With everything
To dance again
Feels so, feels so, feels so good

Vulnerable
Ain't easy, believe me, but I go there
Mm-mm ah-ah
It's like I'm ten feet tall
I'm high off the weight off of my shoulders
Mm-mm ah-ah

I kick-start the rhythm
All the trauma's in remission
No, I don't need permission
I kick-start my system
When I speak, my body listens
I know what I'm missing

Feels so, feels so, feels so good to dance again
Feels so, feels so, feels so good to dance again
With my emotions undressed, I'm going in
With everything
To dance again
Feels so, feels so, feels so good

(Ooh) (Ah) (Ooh) I'm feeling
(Ooh) (Ah) (Ooh) Me again
(Ooh) (Ah) (Ooh) Feels so good to dance again (Ah)
Feels so, feels so, feels so good

(So, so, so good)

Happiness
Ain't something you sit back and you wait for
Feels so, feels so, feels so good to dance again, ah

Feels so, feels so, feels so good to dance again
With my emotions undressed, I'm going in (Going)
With everything (Everything)
To dance again
Feels so, feels so, feels so good

I kick-start the rhythm (Ooh) (Ah)
All the trauma's in remission (Ooh I'm feeling)
Mmm (Ooh) (Ah) mmm (Me again)
I kick-start the rhythm (Ooh) (Ah)
All the trauma's in remission (Ooh I'm feeling)
Mmm (Ooh) (Ah) feels so, feels so, feels so good

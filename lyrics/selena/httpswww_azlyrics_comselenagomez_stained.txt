"Stained"



You were the one, the one that I could run to
You were the one, the one that I would beg for, no
And you were the one that made me believe that I could be better
Yeah, you were the one, the one that I would run to

Now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I'm stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I'm stained by you
(By you, by you, oh oh)

You had a way of making me feel special, yeah
Then take it away and say I wasn't special, no
And now it's messed up
That bad kind of love is the only thing that makes me better
Yeah you had your way, I'm trying to pull myself together

'Cause now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I'm stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I'm stained by you
(By you, by you, oh oh)

Oh, it should be easy to let you go
But I love you and I hate that you know
It should be easy to let you go
But I love you and I hate that you know

Now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I'm stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I'm stained by you
(By you, by you, oh oh)

"Shake It Up"



Don't like waiting [2x]
Let's go right now!
Gotta hit the ground
Dancing 'fore the music slows down

What I'm sayin' [2x]
If there's something to fix
Take it to another level,
This is the remix

Everybody, everybody
Get out on the floor
It can get a little crazy
When the kick hits the floor

Make a scene [2x]
Nobody can ignore
Don't knock it, 'til you rock it
We can't take it no more!

Bring the lights up!
Bust the doors down!
Dust yourself off,
Shake it up!
Shake it up!

DJ set it off!
Take it up a notch
All together now!
Shake it up!
Shake it up!

Shake it up!

Break it down [2x]
I've got something to say
When you're dancin' with me,
It's like we go MIA

Make a scene [2x]
Nobody can ignore
Don't knock it, 'til you rock it
We can't take it no more!

Bring the lights up!
Bust the doors down!
Dust yourself off,
Shake it up!
Shake it up!

DJ set it off!
Take it up a notch
All together now!
Shake it up!
Shake it up!

Sh-sh-sh-shake it up,
You gotta change it up!
And if the day's not right
Just brush it off tonight!

Put on the attitude!
You're in my pocket mood
And when you've had enough,
Sh-sh-sh-shake it up!

[3x]
Bring the lights up!
Bust the doors down!
Dust yourself off,
Shake it up!
Shake it up!
DJ set it off!
Take it up a notch
All together now!
Shake it up!
Shake it up!

[3x:]
Shake it up!
Shake it up!

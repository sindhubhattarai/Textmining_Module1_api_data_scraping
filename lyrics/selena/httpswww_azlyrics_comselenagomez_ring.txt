"Ring"



You're all in your feelings baby
All into me
I'm one in a billion baby
Don't you agree?
Obviously, you know I'm aware of that
I'm breaking hearts like a heart attack
Got him right where the karats at

Wrapped 'round my finger like a ring, ring, ring
They just like puppets on a string, string, string
I put it down, they call me up
They doing way too much
So I just let it ring, ring, ring (Ooh ooh)

Yeah, I received your message, all twenty-three (Twenty-three)
You know I'm Jordan with it, G-O-A-T (G-O-A-T)
Obviously, you know I'm aware of that
I'm breaking hearts like a heart attack
I got him right where the karats at

Wrapped 'round my finger like a ring, ring, ring
They just like puppets on a string, string, string
I put it down, they call me up
They doing way too much
So I just let it ring, ring, ring

Wrapped 'round my finger like a ring, ring, ring
They want to give me everything, thing, thing
I put it down, they call me up
(Oh, no-no-no-no-no)
So I just let it ring, ring, ring

Circling me they just like satellites
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Circling me, all day and every night
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Circling me, I'm sure you sympathize
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh-na-na

Wrapped 'round my finger like a ring, ring, ring
They just like puppets on a string, string, string
I put it down, they call me up
They doing way too much
So I just let it ring, ring, ring

Wrapped 'round my finger like a ring, ring, ring
They want to give me everything, thing, thing
I put it down, they call me up
(Oh, no-no-no-no-no)
So I just let it ring, ring, ring

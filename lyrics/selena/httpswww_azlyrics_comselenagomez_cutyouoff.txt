"Cut You Off"



Pull up to the mirror, staring at my face
Gotta chop-chop all the extra weight
I've been carrying for fourteen-hundred sixty days
Gotta, gotta, gotta clean my slate

And I might as well just tell you while I'm drunk, yeah
The truth is that I think I've had enough
Professionally messing with my trust
How could I confuse that shit for love?

So I gotta get
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now
I just cut you off
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now
I just cut you off
When I'm without
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I don't overthink it, I just carry on, get
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now
I just cut you off

I imagine all the endless places I could know
With a drop-drop and I let you go
All the possibilities I've got from head to toe
Yeah they'd, yeah they'd, yeah they'd start to show

And I might as well just tell you while I'm drunk, yeah
The truth is that I think I've had enough
Emotionally messing with my health
How could I confuse that shit for love?

So I gotta get
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now
I just cut you off
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now
I just cut you off
When I'm without
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I don't overthink it, I just carry on, get
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now
I just, I just

You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now
(I just)
(When I'm without)
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now

So I gotta get
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now
I just (I just) cut you off (Yeah, I cut you off)
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now
I just cut you off
When I'm without
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I don't overthink it, I just carry on, get
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now
I just, I just, yeah

## ADS 509: Data Acquisition with APIs and Scraping

Acquiring data is one of the fundamental steps in any analysis and proficiency at APIs and web scraping unlocks rich data sets for future analyses. Here I have  pulled the data from the Twitter API and scrape lyrics from AZlyrics.com.  

1. Choosed two musical artists for  project.The artists are Selena Gomez and Adele Both  have at least 100,000 followers on Twitter and at least twenty songs at their artist page on AZLyrics. Those pages have forms like this: https://www.azlyrics.com/r/robyn.html. 
2.
    * In the first part of the assignment, data is pulled from Twitter. Pulled the descriptions of all followers for each of the artists.
    * In the second part I pulled and stored the lyrics for both artists.


Note: Storing API keys in repositories is not recommended. An example .py file is posted to Blackboard.
